Name:Babinka's Potato Salad
Ingredients:4 Large potatoes (to be diced after boiling)|||4 hard-boiled eggs, diced|||3 heaping Tablespoons mayonnaise|||1 heaping Tablespoon mustard|||About 1/2 or more of a large pickle, diced|||About 1/2 cup or more, cooked peas|||Lawrey's (or other) Season Salt, to taste
Preparation:Peel the potatoes, boil them for forty minutes or slightly more.  They should be barely firm enough to dice them (without mashing them).  Allow the potatoes to cool before trying to dice them.  When dicing, the chunks can be fairly coarse. Dice the eggs and pickles.  These chunks should be smaller than the potato chunks, perhaps the size of large peas. Mix all ingredients in a large bowl.  Adjust the mayo, mustard, and salt, to taste.

Name:Babinka's Dumplings
Ingredients:2 cups Wondra flour (note -- no other flour will make dumplings quite the same way)|||3/4 cup milk (warm)|||1/2 to 3/4 tsp. sugar|||pinch of salt, dash of cooking oil|||1/2 to 3/4 tsp. Double Acting Yeast|||(optional) Croutons (about 1 cup) -- or about 1 slice of well-toasted bread, cubed, for 2 dumplings
Preparation:Mix the yeast, sugar, pinch of salt and dash of oil, into the milk, until the yeast is well dissolved.  Allow the yeast mixture to get bubbly -- about 10 minutes or so. In a large bowl, mix the 2 cups Wondra flour into the liquid.  If necessary, add a little more milk.  Dough should be just a little bit moist and sticky, but firm enough that it can be peeled from the sides of the mixing bowl easily.  Don't let them get too greasy -- don't use too much oil, don't put oil on your hands to knead them. Knead the dough about 3-5 minutes by hand, or maybe less if using a machine.  Fold in the croutons while doing so. Turn the dough over in a greased bowl, then separate the dough into two (or more) loaf-shapes, so that you don't have to beat down the dough before boiling.  Cover the two loaves with a towel (or towels), and allow to rise in a warm place until it is at least double (about 40 minutes to 1 hour). Transfer the loaves carefully and boil the two loaves in a large pot of boiling water -- large enough that you can flip over the dumplings from time to time.  In Santa Fe, at almost 7000 feet, they should boil for 40 minutes or more.  At lower elevations, they might need to boil longer. Slice with a wire dumpling-cutter if you're lucky enough to have one.  Otherwise try a bread knife, which usually mangles the dumplings, because they are sticky and soft.
